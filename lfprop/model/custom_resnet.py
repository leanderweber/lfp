    """Wide ResNet-101-2 model from
    `Wide Residual Networks <https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07146>`_.

    The model is the same as ResNet except for the bottleneck number of channels
    which is twice larger in every block. The number of channels in outer 1x1
    convolutions is the same, e.g. last block in ResNet-101 has 2048-512-2048
    channels, and in Wide ResNet-101-2 has 2048-1024-2048.

    Args:
        weights (:class:`~torchvision.models.Wide_ResNet101_2_Weights`, optional): The
            pretrained weights to use. See
            :class:`~torchvision.models.Wide_ResNet101_2_Weights` below for
            more details, and possible values. By default, no pre-trained
            weights are used.
        progress (bool, optional): If True, displays a progress bar of the
            download to stderr. Default is True.
        **kwargs: parameters passed to the ``torchvision.models.resnet.ResNet``
            base class. Please refer to the `source code
            <https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/main/torchvision/models/resnet.py>`_
